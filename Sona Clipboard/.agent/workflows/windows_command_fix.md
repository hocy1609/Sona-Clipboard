# Windows Command Safety Fix

When running commands on Windows, the `run_command` tool may append an extra quote or malform the command string, causing it to hang or fail.
To fix this, wrap the command in `cmd /c` and append `& ::` to the end. This executes the command and then executes a comment, which safely absorbs any trailing garbage characters.

## Pattern
`cmd /c <your_command> & ::`

## Examples

Instead of:
`dir`
Use:
`cmd /c dir & ::`

Instead of:
`python main.py`
Use:
`cmd /c python main.py & ::`
